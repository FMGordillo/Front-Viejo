## Pendings

- [ ] [Add support to different languages](https://github.com/stefalda/react-localization)
- [ ] Audit and improve accesability

## Guidelines

### General

- Always use `.jsx` extension for components
  - Exceptions are all but rendering stuff
- Components should be **Function Components**
- Funcion Components should be functions being exported as `default`.
  - Be **very careful** with the re usage. If it has no usage, it must be inside a specific folder
- Hooks are _highly_ recommended, though not necessary
- Respect the functional libraries installed in `package.json`
  - For example, do **not** use `<a href="#">` for Components, instead for external links. Use **`<Link>`** for internal navigation (inside React)
